ROS nodes: Launch ROS core and carry out the following tasks
(a) List the currently running nodes
    		/rosout
(b) What is the purpose of node /rosout
    		to get output
(c) List the currently running topics
		/rosout
		/rosout_agg
(d) What topics are subscribed by the node /rosout
  		  /rosout [unknown type]
(e) What topics are published by the node /rosout
     		 /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log]
(f) What are the services provided by the node /rosout
		 * /rosout/get_loggers
 		* /rosout/set_logger_level
(g) Kill the node /rosout and again list the running nodes. What is your observation.
		/rosout regenerates after being killed
(h) What are the functions of commands cleanup, info, kill, list, machine &
ping of the rosnode command-line tool 
         rosnode ping    test connectivity to node
        rosnode list    list active nodes
        rosnode info    print information about node
        rosnode machine list nodes running on a particular machine or list machines
        rosnode kill    kill a running node
        rosnode cleanup purge registration information of unreachable nodes

(2d)		 here all the nodes are publisher nodes and no subscribers ,so the output generated is directly passed on to the ros

(3b) 		the node hari_node 1 is communicating directly with /rosout and the subscribed node RAA 24 subnode
(4a)/M1RAA_2024
    /CET 
    /Hari 
    /rosout
(4b) /hello_class
    /hello_college
    /welcome
    /rosout
    /rosout_agg
    
(4c)  rosout provides output for all the running nodes
